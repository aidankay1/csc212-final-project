For this final project, we elected to implement the Segment Tree data structure in C++. We were given approximately four weeks to complete the project, which included a written report, an oral presentation, and computer-generated visualizations based on our data structure.

## Building & Usage
To test this implementation, create a `main.cpp` file and add any of the functionality outlined in `SegmentTreeMax.hpp`. To compile with GCC, use `g++ main.cpp SegmentTreeMax.cpp -o main`. Then, simply run the program with `./main`.

To incorporate this implementation into your own code, add the relevant methods and be sure to link `SegmentTreeMax.cpp` at compile time. To avoid bloated build commands, consider creating a makefile for your project.
