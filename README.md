For the final project, we elected to implement the Segment Tree data structure in C++. We were given approximately four weeks to complete the project, which included a written report, an oral presentation, and computer-generated visualizations based on our data structure.

## What is data structure
Data structure is a method used to store and organize data. It gives us a way of arranging data on computer so that the data can be processed, accessed, and update efficiently. Data structure play an important role in alogrithm design and how the alogrithms are used within computer which is why it is important to used the right data structure for a project depending on the requirements for the project. There are two categoies which data structure are divided into but for this project the non-primitives data structure is what we are going to step into because the project fall into the non-primitves data structure of linear and non-linear data structure.

#### Types of data structure
* Linear data structure

   It is a data structure where data element are arrange sequentially or linearly one after the other. Linear data structure are easy to implement since they have data element linearly one after the other. Examples of linear data structure are array, stack, queue, and linked list.

* Non-linear data structure

   It is a data structure where data element are not arrange sequentially or linearly one after the other but instead data element are arrange in hierachical where one element is connect to one element or more elements. They are not esay to implement but non linear data structure utilizes computer memory efficiently. Examples of non-linear data structure are trees and graph.
